# DataAnalysis

This program performs a data analysis of a data set using the SAS programming language.

-In essence I take a data setand put the data in different groups based on the number of replications for a an experiment. In this case there were two replications. 

-I then place each data set into a bucket set for comparison. This is done by determing the variabble of each data set and calcuating whethering whether it falls into each bucket by factoring out the variables

Must register with the SAS online system to run program. 

My conclusions on the Data analysis are on my personal computer. Email me at aclark69@emich.edu for more info.
